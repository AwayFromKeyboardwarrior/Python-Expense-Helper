Automated Expense Requester

This is an automated expense requester.
I made it in order for ABB employees to spend less time on their expense request.
How to do : 
1. Excute the program
2. Load the excel files you can easily download from the Card webpage
3. Run ABB Expense Webpage
4. Press start button
5. load the correct picture for each expense!

Here's how it works : 
1. Find the right values from the excel file you chose
2. Decide the category by its price (for example, if the cost you spend exceeds 35000, it will be categorized as 'Accommodation')
3. Automatically fill out the form

while the progress, you need to choose the picture that contains the receipt of the item you're requesting for expense.(ABB policy)
